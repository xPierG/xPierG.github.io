## About

Over time, my work has increasingly focused on how innovation and AI work in practice, particularly in complex, fast-moving environments where ways of working, decision-making and execution make the difference between ideas and results.

Deep down, I'm a software engineer. This shapes how I lead: my work is about crafting business strategy with the exec team and turning it into results—bridging the chasm between a great idea and tech that ships, one agile sprint at a time.

My career has been a bit of a wild ride, from the pit lanes of Ferrari F1 to the roaring engines at Ducati. Today, as Chief Innovation and Data Officer at Credem Bank, I'm bringing that same speed and innovation mindset to finance. It all started with slinging code at Elsag, a former Finmeccanica giant, and cutting my teeth on data and AI at Iconsulting.

My approach is simple: less slides, more code. I'm less interested in buzzwords and more focused on applying emerging tech like AI and agile methods to build things that actually work.

When I'm not at the bank, I'm still building. I co-founded ImpactHub Reggio Emilia and love jumping into the trenches with tech startups. You'll also find me on conference stages or in university halls, talking (probably too much) about AI, digital strategy, and agile.

My goal is simple: challenge the status quo and build what's next.
